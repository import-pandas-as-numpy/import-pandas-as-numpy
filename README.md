## Vipyr Security Team Lead
Hey there! I am a cybersecurity student and researcher with a passion for open source trust and security. I direct operations of a volunteer malware analysis team focused on early detection, documentation, reversal, and reporting of malicious packages and software distributed primarily through open source venues such as GitHub and PyPI. 
My principle focus is on reverse engineering utilizing tools such as GDB/Ghidra/Ida, as well as day to day decisionmaking on development paths for Vipyr Security; but I can often be found coding Python scripts for cybersecurity applications as well.
